OK, some of the bugs include: 

Math operations working reliabily with [] parens, yet unrealiable with (), regardless of the same code that handles them.

Divsion by zero within parens yeilds infinity, regardless of my checks for divsion by zero.

For the extra credit, I did code in a check that prints and error that works without parens.
