The test cases work and yeild either true, false, or null coresponding to the success or failure of each method call

A 3x3 blank mode successfully works within a couple seconds
A 4x4 blank, im not sure if there is an infinint loop or if it just takes a long ass time to solve. if its an endless loop, why did'nt the 3x3 blank mode pick it up.

For fill mode, everything returns an unsucessfull null, not sure why if the test methods work as expected.
